# Minesweeper-Solver
Training a Minesweeper solver using Q-learning and Deep Q-learning 

How to run
-----------

Folder - Minesweeper_Qlearning:

Run minesweeper_qlearning.py to run the program. The program will first train x number of games first. This 'x' parameter can be modified and changed via changing the value of the numLearningIterations variable in minesweeper_qlearning.py . Then the program will test 'y' number of games and will generate the results. This 'y' parameter can be changed via numPlayingIterations variable.
The variable display_game is set to 'True' initially. It will give a demo as to how the minesweeper is running in a visual manner. To turn this off, set this variable to 'False'.

Folder - MinesweeperDQN:
Run minesweeper_qlearning.py to run the program. This program will generate the results. 
Prerequisites: Keras library.
